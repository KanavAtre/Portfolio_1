## Overview

A small web tool that takes an article URL and generates an **APA-style citation** by scraping metadata and applying NLP fallbacks when fields are missing. It also includes a **semantic analysis** mode that surfaces the most frequent meaningful keywords from the page.

## What I Built

- **URL ingestion + scraping** with headers to fetch article HTML and extract page text
- **Metadata parsing** for title/author when available (e.g. `meta[name="author"]`, `<title>`)
- **NLP fallback extraction** using **spaCy** to detect likely **PERSON** (author) and **DATE** entities
- **Keyword analysis** using **NLTK stopword filtering** + frequency counts (top 3 keywords)
- **Streamlit UI** with two modes:
  - Generate citation (editable fields for title/author/date)
  - Semantic analysis (keywords + counts)

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **BeautifulSoup + Requests**
- **spaCy**
- **NLTK**
- **Pandas (utility / data handling)**

## Results

- Generates a usable citation workflow from a single URL with editable extracted fields  
- Provides quick semantic signal via top keywords to summarize page content at a glance
