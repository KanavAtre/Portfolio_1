## Overview

**BoilerFixIt** is a marketplace-style web app that connects **Purdue students** with **community service providers** for repairs and maintenance (appliances, small fixes, etc.).  
The goal: make it frictionless to discover providers, request service, and handle checkout securely.

## What It Does

- Students can browse/request services and manage requests from a clean UI.
- Providers can respond to requests and coordinate fulfillment.
- Payments are handled through **Stripe** with a secure checkout flow.
- Account security is handled with **JWT auth**, **bcrypt password hashing**, and **OTP verification**.

## Key Features

- **Authentication & Security**
  - JWT-based login/session flow
  - Password hashing with bcrypt
  - OTP verification for account validation / sensitive actions

- **Service Marketplace Flow**
  - Service listings + request creation
  - Request tracking and basic workflow state (submitted → in progress → completed)

- **Payments**
  - Stripe client integration using `@stripe/react-stripe-js`
  - Clean handoff from frontend → backend for payment intent / confirmation

- **Automated Emails**
  - Transactional notifications (verification, confirmations, updates)

## Tech Stack

### Frontend (Repo)
- **React (CRA)** + `react-scripts`
- **React Router** for routing
- **Material UI (MUI)** for UI components
- **Stripe Elements** (`@stripe/react-stripe-js`, `@stripe/stripe-js`)
- **Axios** for API calls
- **React Hook Form** for form state/validation

### Backend (Project)
- **Node.js + Express**
- **MongoDB + Mongoose**
- **JWT Auth** + **bcrypt**
- **OTP verification**
- **Email pipelines** (transactional notifications)
- **REST API** design + testing via Postman

## Implementation Highlights

### 1) Secure Auth (JWT + bcrypt)

The backend issues JWTs after login, and protected routes validate the token. Passwords are hashed with bcrypt.

- Hash passwords on signup / reset
- Verify credentials on login
- Store JWT in a secure client strategy (cookie-based is ideal; localStorage works but has tradeoffs)

### 2) Stripe Checkout Flow

Frontend uses Stripe Elements, then confirms payment using a backend-created PaymentIntent.

```tsx
// frontend (conceptual)
const handlePay = async () => {
  // 1) Create PaymentIntent on server
  const { data } = await axios.post("/api/payments/create-intent", {
    amount: totalCents,
  })

  // 2) Confirm payment in client with Stripe Elements
  const result = await stripe.confirmCardPayment(data.clientSecret, {
    payment_method: { card: elements.getElement(CardElement)! },
  })

  if (result.error) throw result.error
  // 3) Success → update order/request status
}
